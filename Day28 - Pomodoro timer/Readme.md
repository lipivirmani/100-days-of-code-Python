# Pomodoro Timer

A simple and effective productivity application built using Python and Tkinter, designed to implement the Pomodoro technique for managing work and break intervals efficiently.

---

## Features

- **Customizable Timer**: Allows users to set durations for work and break intervals.
- **Auto-Focus Window**: Automatically brings the timer window to the foreground to ensure visibility.
- **Progress Tracker**: Uses checkmarks (âœ”) to represent completed work sessions visually.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI built with Tkinter.

## How It Works

1. The timer alternates between work and break periods based on preset durations.
2. At the start of each session, the window is brought to focus to minimize distractions.
3. The application tracks completed work sessions and displays progress as checkmarks.
